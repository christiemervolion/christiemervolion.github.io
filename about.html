      <h1>Hello there</h1>
      
      <p>Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Christie Mervolion and I am a part-time writer and full-time crazy dog lady. Born and raised in beautiful Miami, Fl (shoutout to the 305), I have never lived anywhere else but have my sights set on the west coast.</p>
      
      <p>This May I'll be graduating with Bachelor of Science in Communication from the University of Miami (another shoutout to all my 'Canes). During my undergraduate career, I majored in Journalism and minored in Public Relations and Creative Writing.</p>
      
      <p>Even from a young age, I've always been fascinated with words and the many ways the right ones can inspire and transform the world around us. In addition to reading and writing, my other areas of interest include photography, ballet and contemporary dance, dogs and of course, Beyonce.</p>
